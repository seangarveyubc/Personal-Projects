/*
	Including JS in HTML files
*/

// need to include the JS inside script tags
// inluding multiple scripts needs multiple script tags
	// <script src="..."> ... </script>

// large scripts are included in separate files, taking advantage of the computer's caching system

/* script tags cannot have both a source and content inside. This means you can place alerts inside the tag that will notify the dev of any failure to import */
